# Data-Analysis-using-SQL-and-Power-BI
In this project I have worrked on finding the valuable insights from the given dataset in order to understand the 
present trend about the business, customers, latest trend and similar other important questions. 
I first used SQL queries to do all the analyssi produced some required output ,
then I stored them in the form of tables and then with the help of POWER BI , made dynamic charts for Data Visulization.
